SigmaDB is a lightweight, versatile noSQL library written in rust.

There are two supported "operation modes" for SigmaDB.

Network and Local

In local mode, you can bind code with SigmaDB operations.

In network mode (which is in development), you can create a SigmaDB server and use a builtin api functionality to get and set data to the Server
